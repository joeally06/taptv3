              The TAPT School Bus Driver Hall of Fame was created to recognize and honor Tennessee School Bus Drivers who have made outstanding contributions to their local school transportation department and who, by virtue of those contributions, are considered to be among the industry's most dedicated individuals.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Induction into the TAPT Hall of Fame represents one of the highest honors that TAPT can bestow on an individual. Honorees must meet the highest standards of personal and professional integrity, including distinguished service to the school children in their school district.
            </p>
            <p>
              The nominee will have demonstrated an extraordinary commitment of time and energy to the safe transportation of our Tennessee school children.
